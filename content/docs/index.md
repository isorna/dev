#Â The eternal apprentice

Technology improves incessantly, to a point where we are not able to keep up with the news and we end up assuming the risk of developing blindly, reading the minimum to be able to use the trendy library or framework, or the AI plugin that theoretically it will save us time and earn more money...

From my point of view, I believe that we are losing the ability to reflect and learn, in exchange for achieving the much-demanded immediacy that today's world imposes on us.

I have decided to find a solution that will help me to face current and future projects, a solid base but flexible enough to adapt new technologies when necessary, an example of reflection and understanding of the tools with which I have worked in recent years and the ones I would like to use from now on.

I think the best way to contribute to the development community is to make it an open project and share my thoughts, explaining why each piece of the framework is useful and how we can get the most out of it. In the same way, I hope to be able to learn from the comments received and improve it little by little, since it is a living project and it will probably never be complete.

Finally I would like to emphasize that I am not just trying to put together a series of pieces of software to make them work well. I would also like to bring improvements in the day-to-day of project management and take full advantage of the automation and interpretation tools that we have, thus improving the management and development experience from all possible angles.
